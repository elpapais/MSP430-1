Example Program:
---------------

This is a very basic baremetals program which simply turns ON and OFF the launchpad's programmable LEDs.

startUp.s is the assembly source, which calls the buck(){something like main()..} from the boot.c file.

memmap is the linker script.

stay tuned for more updates...
